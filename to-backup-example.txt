# Supposing you are user 'foo', you can list the paths like this, but they all should be absolute:
/home/foo/.bashrc
/home/foo/.gitconfig
/home/foo/.config/some_dir

# To backup the whole dir
/etc/something

# to backup a single file, go like this:
/etc/moresomething/file.conf
/var/log/some.log

# copy this file somewhere convenient and remove comment lines
