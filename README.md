## Future considerations
*Note* that this repo does not aim to provide the full OOTB desktop experience. These dotfiles, as well as script, are for the community members who want a clean ricing base to lean on. Use this repo to build your own setup and do not forget to share it!
*Also Note:* some paths in my dots are absolute (which means you have to adjust them to ~/ instead of /home/user/)
